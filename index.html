  <h2>Base Outcome Calculator</h2>
  <p>This calculator displays all possible bases that can result from a certain breeding. It does not include any probability or chance, rather it just shows potential outcomes. Certain bases possible in a breeding may be much rarer to obtain than others.</p>

  <h2>Lifetime Heats Calculator</h2>
  <p>This calculator will tell you have many heats your wolf has left before they die. This assumes that your wolf is always bred on the first day of their heat. If you plan on instant delivering every one of your wolf's litters right after they are bred, select the checkbox below that indicates this.</p>

<p>
My wolf is <input type="number" id="year2" min="1" max ="7"> years and <input type="number" id="month2" min="0" max ="11.5" step="0.5"> months old.<br>

<div class="small">
<i>If your wolf is currently nursing, you can check exactly how many rollovers are left in their breeding cooldown by hovering over or tapping on the hourglass icon by their info on your den page! Their nesting period is included in their breeding cooldown.</i></div>

  <h2>Unbred/Male Heats Calculator</h2>
  <p>Every wolf, regardless of sex, has a heat cycle! It doesn't show on male wolves, but it coorelates to their age. Depending on their age, a male wolf might go immediately into heat when they're sex changed. This calculator will tell you if your male wolf would be in heat if you were to sex change them, or how far away their heat would be!<br><br>Using an aging crystal on a pup or adolescent messes with this heat cycle. Aging crystal functionality coming soon!<br></p>
